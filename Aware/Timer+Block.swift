        Creates and returns a new `Timer` object and schedules it on the current run loop in the default mode.

        - Parameters:
            - seconds: The number of seconds between firings of the timer. If seconds is less than or equal to 0.0, this method chooses the nonnegative value of 0.1 milliseconds instead.
            - userInfo: The user info for the timer. The timer maintains a strong reference to this object until it (the timer) is invalidated. This parameter may be nil.
            - repeats: If true, the timer will repeatedly reschedule itself until invalidated. If false, the timer will be invalidated after it fires.
            - fire: The block to call when the timer fires. The timer maintains a strong reference to target until it (the timer) is invalidated.

        - Returns: A new `Timer` object, configured according to the specified parameters.

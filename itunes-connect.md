**Description**

A simple menubar app for macOS that tracks how long you've been actively using your computer.

Aware tells you how long you've been using your computer in hours and minutes. It knows this because it detects the movements of your mouse and the keystrokes on your keyboard. After a short time of inactivity (a break), Aware will pause the timer, then reset and start again when more activity is detected.

There are no assumptions made as to what you do with this information. No popups or alarms to tell you to take a break, just a record of time tracked in your menubar for easy access.

## visionOS App

**Description**

A simple usage timer for visionOS that shows you how long you've been continuously wearing Vision Pro.

Open Aware and place the timer window anywhere you'd like. The timer keeps running until you take off the device and restarts from zero when you put it back on to start a new session. No need to close the app, the timer resets itself.

Use Aware to remind yourself to take breaks from wearing Vision Pro or gauge your productivity after a long session.
